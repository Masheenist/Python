### Welcome to:
# **Python First Principles**
My name is [Andy Young](http://www.atydev.com) and together we'll be working through [**Zed Shaw's**](https://zedshaw.com/) seminal series: [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/). With persistance and hardwork we may continue with "Learn [_More_ Python](https://learncodethehardway.org/more-python-book/) the Hard Way". If you wish to purchase a copy, I recommend [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0134692888/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_zINWBbFZ3SCM1) because it's cheaper than bookstores.

I'm excited to have you here and I encourage you to peruse the table of contents and see :eyes: what lays ahead.
