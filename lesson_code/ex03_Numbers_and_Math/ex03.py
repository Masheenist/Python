# Study Drills
# 1. Comment above each line and explain what's happening below it. Notice that print() takes arguments..
# 2. Open the Python Interpreter and use it like a calculator
# 3. Rewrite this program with 'floating point' numbers for more accuracy --> 20 becomes 20.0
# 4. Look up the 'modulo' operator in the Python Docs --> https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html
